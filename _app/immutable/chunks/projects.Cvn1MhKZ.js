## Components and Working Procedure

### Main Components

* **F450 Frame:** Provides the structural foundation for mounting all other components.
* **Brushless Motors (x4):**  Generate the thrust required for flight.
* **Propellers (x4):** Convert the rotational motion of the motors into thrust.
* **Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs) (x4):** Regulate the speed of the brushless motors based on signals from the flight controller.
* **Pixhawk 2.4.8 (Flight Controller):** The brain of the quadcopter, responsible for processing sensor data and controlling the motors to achieve stable flight.
* **GPS Module:** Provides location information for position hold and autonomous navigation.
* **Radio Transmitter:** Allows manual control of the quadcopter.


### Camera and Livestreaming Components

* **Pi Cam:** Captures video footage.
* **Raspberry Pi 3:** Processes the video feed from the Pi Cam and transmits it wirelessly.
* **2-axis Pan-Tilt Brackets:** Allows movement of the camera for directional control of the video feed.
* **Servo (x2):** Controls the movement of the pan-tilt brackets.

### Signal Conversion

The following illustrates the signal flow from the transmitter to the Pixhawk flight controller:

1. **Transmitter:** Sends control signals in Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) format.
2. **Receiver:** Receives the PWM signals from the transmitter.
3. **Arduino Mega (Signal Converter):**  Converts the multiple PWM signals from the receiver into a single  Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) signal.  This simplifies the connection to the Pixhawk.
4. **Pixhawk:** Receives the PPM signal and interprets it to control the quadcopter. *The Pixhawk has an interrupt pin connected to the Arduino Mega to synchronize data transmission and ensure reliable communication.*

## Key Features
The feature are elaborated with their respective technical implementations.

### Flight Modes

* **Altitude Hold Mode:** Maintains stable hover at desired height. Uses a barometric pressure sensor on the Pixhawk to measure altitude and a PID controller implemented within the Pixhawk firmware to adjust motor thrust based on the altitude error.
* **Position Hold Mode:** Maintains a fixed position in 3D space using GPS data processed by the Pixhawk.  A more complex PID control loop is used to maintain both altitude and horizontal position.  Corrections are made to motor thrust to counteract wind drift and maintain a stable hover.
* **Autonomous Flight Mode:** Allows pre-programmed waypoint navigation.  Waypoints are uploaded to the Pixhawk, and the flight controller autonomously guides the quadcopter along the specified path.  (Further details on obstacle avoidance implementation would be beneficial if implemented).
* **Land Mode:** Initiates a controlled descent and auto-levels the quadcopter during landing for a safe touchdown. This mode uses a combination of altitude and attitude control, ensuring a smooth landing.


### Surveillance Capabilities

* **Real-time video transmission:** The Raspberry Pi 3 receives the video feed from the Pi Cam, compresses it, and transmits it wirelessly to a ground station (laptop/computer).
* **HD camera with stabilized gimbal:** The Pi Cam provides high-definition video footage.  The 2-axis pan-tilt mechanism, controlled by servos connected to the Raspberry Pi, provides rudimentary stabilization and directional control of the camera view.
* **Live video feed to ground station:** The ground station receives and displays the live video stream, enabling real-time monitoring.
* **Recording capabilities for mission review:**  The Raspberry Pi can simultaneously record the video feed to local storage for later analysis and review.


## Technical Implementation (Expanded Details)

* **Microcontroller-based flight control system:**  The Pixhawk 2.4.8 acts as the central flight controller.
* **Sensor fusion for stable flight:** The Pixhawk integrates data from multiple sensors, including the GPS, barometric pressure sensor, accelerometer, and gyroscope, to provide accurate and reliable flight information.
* **Custom PID tuning for optimal performance:** The PID control loops for altitude hold and position hold were tuned specifically for the hardware configuration of the quadcopter to achieve stable and responsive performance.
* **Wireless telemetry for real-time monitoring:**  The Pixhawk transmits telemetry data wirelessly to the ground station, providing real-time information about the quadcopter's status, including battery voltage, altitude, GPS coordinates, and other critical parameters.

## Recognition and Awards
This was the first successful implementation of a drone/quadcopter in BUET CSE department's history. But the accolades did not stop there.

The project's innovative design and successful implementation earned it the prestigious Second Place in the Top Term Projects competition. This recognition highlights the technical excellence and practical significance of SkyWatch in autonomous aerial systems.

2. Instruction Decode
3. Execution
4. Memory Access & Write Back (combined)

### Hardware Specifications
- 8-bit data bus
- 8-bit address bus
- 8-bit ALU
- Separate instruction and data memory
- Pipeline registers between stages

### Performance Features
The pipelining implementation allows multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously, significantly improving throughput and computational efficiency.`,c=[{slug:"taskflow",color:"#ff3e00",description:n,shortDescription:"Comprehensive task planner with AI Assistant for content generation.
